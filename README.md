# Inheritence-
This is an object oriented project that shows my understanding of inheritance by simulating a toll. Each car gets an account. 
There are 3 types of accounts: one for cars, one for trucks and one for emergency vehicles. Cars have a person owner with a first and
last name, a license plate, and an account number. When a car crossed a bridge the charge is $5. Trucks have a corporation owner, a
license plate, and an account number. When a truck crosses the bridge, it is charged $3 per axle. Emergency vehicles are also in the 
system, but cross the bridge for free. 
These emergency vehicles have a government owner, an account number and a license plate.
